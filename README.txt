Quickly set up a settings page type table view. You no longer need multiple if and switch statement with UITableViewDelegate. Just use a simple array to contain all the table cells you wish to display and let DCCustomTable do the rest.

You can even quickly set up to have table mutate during use.

Just enter the header, footer information of section, the appropriate cells for the section and let DCCustomTable handle the table view delegate.

Please read the sample project to see what is how this code can help you.
